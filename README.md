# Jampbot++ is a discord.js bot I made for my Discord server, [Team Jamp](https://discord.gg/STbuRN)

## This bot includes:

- A **dynamic command handler** with toggleable options for commands such as cooldowns, aliases, and permissions

- A **config.json file** containting easily accessable and editable information and commonly used strings such as prefixes

- A system to **ping the bot** every 5 minutes so it never falls asleep

- Auto saves every 15 minutes to decrease risk of the bot getting **banned from Discord**

- Blacklists for **users _and_ channels** allowing complete control over bot accessability

- Much much more!
