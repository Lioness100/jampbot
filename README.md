## About Team Jamp:

Team Jamp is a relatively new Mario Maker 2 team centered **all around platforming**.

If you want a more traditional platforming kaizo experience without tons of tough tech, you're gonna love this team!

We have a **very active and growing community** who can help you feel right at home!

We also have a very complex discord bot (this is just a secondary fun bot, [here's the main one](https://github.com/TeamShellSMM/ShellBot3000)) and [website](https://makerteams.net/teamjamp) that can automatically track clears, new level submissions, and much **_much_** more!

And of course, we have our own **design competitions and level races with unique prizes**! We hope to give everyone the Jamp experience they deserve, so [come join](https://discord.gg/STbuRN)!

Team Jamp has been an incredible experience for me personally, with all of the countless hours just hanging out with all the members and chatting.

Not to mention, Team Jamp's collection of member-made SMM2 levels is **astounding**, probably some of my favorite levels in the game.

Sorry for the slight tangent, I just love Jamping :D
